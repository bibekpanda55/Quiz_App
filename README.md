# Quiz_App
It is basically a quiz app created using a existing url and importing question and answers from it using Json.
I have used sound effect and some animation for making it intresting for the user.
Current score and HighScore is saved once the user closes the app.
A share button is added so the user share his/her current and highscore and let other person know that he/she is playing the game.
There are many questions so I haved saved the state too, so once the user closes the app 
and on reopening it the user can start from the question he/she have left from.
